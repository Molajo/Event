## Events

A certain point in time in a process that a *requester* schedules with a *dispatcher*
 which then delegates management of the event to an *event dispatcher* responsible to
  initiate registered *listeners* and return the collective results to the *dispatcher*
  which, in turn, provides the *requester* the results.
